# User Stories

I have attempted to distill the instructions into some user stories, for my own benefit, but I thought I might as well keep the file in the repo so you can see what I have understood from the original brief.  I have assumed the app is aimed at Starlords, since having recently watched Guardians of the Galaxy 2 this will make the build more fun :-)

## Home

✓ As a Starlord I want the homepage to show a list of star systems in descending order by number of planets.
✓ As a Starlord I want the summary listing to show name, distance from earth and number of planets.
✓ As a Starlord I want to be able to sort the list by number of planets or distance from the sun.
As a Starlord I want to be able to filter this list to only systems which have planets.
As a Starlord when I click a star system I want to see detailed information about the star system in a modal dialog.
As a Starlord I want all units of measurement to be clearly advertised.
✓ As an engineer I want the system to avoid retrieving the entire repository contents at once.

## Search

As a Starlord I want to be able to search for star systems' by alternate name.
As a Starlord I want clicking search results to show detailed information in the same manner as from the main listing.
