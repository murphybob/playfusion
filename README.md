# PlayFusion

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

## Setup

```
npm install
```

Dev mode:
```
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

Production build:
```
npm run build
```

This will produce build

## Testing

Run unit tests

```
npm run unit
```

## Browser support

I haven't bothered worrying about browser support so please use something recent and hope for the best.

Tested in Chrome 62.

## Other notes

I bootstrapped the project from the Vue webpack template. There's certainly some config I would prefer to trim if this were a real project, but for this exercise I am content with something which works.
